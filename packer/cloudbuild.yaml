# NOTE: We do not use the serviceAccount key.  Instead, we use service account
# impersonation within Packer.  We do this for a few reasons:
# 1. The serviceAccount key does not appear to support interpolation.
# 2. The serviceAccount key is not supported for triggered builds.
# 3. You have to explicitly set a bucket name for logs, which means you cannot
#    use the default logs bucket.  You'd have to create (and maintain) one.

# There's only one step: Run Packer.
# Packer does all the work; we don't need to deal with any artifacts or images.
